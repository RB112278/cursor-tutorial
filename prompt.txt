Create a simple browser-based 2D platformer game similar to Super Mario Bros using Kaboom.js.

Project details:
- Use plain JavaScript with Kaboom.js.
- The game should have a player character that can move left/right and jump.
- Add gravity so the player falls naturally and lands on platforms.
- Include platforms (like ground and floating blocks).
- The goal is to reach the right side of the level.
- Add one collectible item (like a coin or mushroom) and a message when the player touches it.

File structure:
1. index.html — basic HTML with a canvas and Kaboom script included.
2. style.css — optional minimal styling (can be mostly empty).
3. main.js — all the game logic using Kaboom.js.

Write all the code needed to make this playable in the browser. Keep the code clean and well-commented for a beginner.
